I believe that everyone that reads this blog are familiar with the software named Figma.
If you don't know or not even aware of this software you may read my summarization of what software it is below.

:::info
Figma is a software for designing UI/UX that is free, accessible, and also popular choice of tool for designing prototypes suited **only for demonstration or as a reference point for front-end developers,** it is **not** meant for actual application development, nor it is suited for any development.
:::

In my time in university we've never had any opportunities to develop our own full-stack application until semester 4, which in terms of curriculum, it is quite inconvenient and late. Thus at the time, ambitious student would try and make their own personal projects, join unrelated *(or even related although activity wise unrelated)* organization, have fun while they're young, or join hackathons which usually are hosted by other universities.

And in this instance, I join hackathons since it's the most obvious answer to the answer, although here in my final year I've come to realization that hackathons are bad in a way.

## Hackathons, are NOT *Hackathons* anymore
Nowadays, hackathons in Malaysia are hosted only for business purposes, which most of the time defeats the purpose of an actual *hack*athon where university students compete on a marathon of programming, design, and solution creating with a less-than bare-minimum timeline and limited resources.

You might ask 

> How the heck does this correlate with a UI/UX designing tool?

Well the thing is, most hackathons nowadays focus on *business concepts* rather than technologies that actually existed on this, and most hackathon providers are specially on tight budget constraint so they are not able to organize an event where it would take days-end to accomodate a bunch of students in one hall or room, and thus they have to come out with a solution.

### Erm... what the Figma?
Introducing Figma, the most budget-friendly accomodating prototyping tool that can replicate on how an application work for normal people to see on how it works on the client-side. Because in the end of a hackathon, it's all about how fancy and unique your solution is *(sometimes even a good solution is thrown out due to bad UI design)*

Don't expect hackathons to have technologically advanced or even able judges to judge your product nowadays.

This tool itself is quite easy to use and almost anyone (and I mean **anyone**) can have a grasp on it, and sometimes, the judges they don't put the efforts of your Figma prototyping and interactive demo to your scores.

### Con man's galore
With the on-surge on how many people can get a grasp on Figma, many people started to join Hackathons whethey they are from liberal arts, multimedia, international affairs, pharmacy, ANYONE can join hackathons, it is not an exclusive items to computer science students anymore.

And due to it, many ideas come up as very silly and technologically unrealistic on this current time, I'm not gonna name names on what project I find very silly, but if I may demonstrate myself by creating a fake title that is equivalent to one of the titles that I found in the hackathon, it would be **"Creating an AI powered IoT module to cure colorblindness"**.
