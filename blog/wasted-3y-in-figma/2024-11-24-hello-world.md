I believe that everyone that reads this item are familiar with the software named Figma.
If you don't know or not even aware of this software you may read my summarization of what software it is below.

:::info
Figma is a software for designing UI/UX that is free, accessible, and also popular choice of tool for designing prototypes suited **only for demonstration or as a reference point for front-end developers,** it is **not** meant for actual application development, nor it is suited for any development.

In my time in university we've never had any opportunities to develop our own full-stack application until semester 4, which in terms of curriculum, it is quite inconvenient and late. Thus at the time, ambitious student would try and make their own personal projects, join unrelated *(or even related although activity wise unrelated)* organization, have fun while they're young, or join hackathons which usually are hosted by other universities.

And in this instance, I join hackathons since it's the most obvious answer to the answer, although here in my final year I've come to realization that hackathons are bad in a way.

## Hackathons, are NOT *Hackathons* anymore
Nowadays, hackathons in Malaysia are hosted only for business purposes, which most of the time defeats the purpose of an actual *hack*athon where university students compete on a marathon of programming, design, and solution creating with a less-than bare-minimum timeline and limited resources.

You might ask 

> *"How the heck does this correlate with a UI/UX designing tool?"*
>
> — You (maybe (actually might be someone else)).

Well the thing is, most hackathons nowadays focus on *business concepts* rather than technologies that actually existed on this, and most hackathon providers are specially on tight budget constraint so they are not able to organize an event where it would take days-end to accomodate a bunch of students in one hall or room, and thus they have to come out with a solution.

### Erm... what the Figma?

Introducing Figma, the most budget-friendly accomodating prototyping tool that can *replicate* (I'm saying this word very lightly) on how an application work for normal people to see on how it works on the client-side. Because in the end of a hackathon, it's all about how fancy and unique your solution is *(sometimes even a good solution is thrown out due to bad UI design)*

Don't expect hackathons to have technologically advanced or able judges to judge your product nowadays.

This tool itself is quite easy to use and almost anyone (and I mean **anyone**) can have a grasp on it, and sometimes, the judges they don't put the efforts of your Figma prototyping and interactive demo to your scores.

### Con man's galore
With the on-surge on how many people can get a grasp on Figma, many people started to join Hackathons whether they are from liberal arts, multimedia, international affairs, pharmacy, ANYONE can join hackathons, it is not an exclusive items to computer science students anymore.

And due to it, many ideas come up as very silly and/or technologically unrealistic at this current time, I'm not gonna name names on what project I find very silly, but if I may demonstrate myself by creating a fake title that is equivalent to one of the titles that I found in the hackathon, it would be **"Creating an AI powered IoT module to cure colorblindness"**.

Worst part is that these titles won, because they had market datas and some hypothesis they pulled off from articles without any single living proof.

## What Pushed Me to Grind on Figma
With the Covid going down and face to face hackathons rising up, students like me tend to get persuaded to join these kind of events since it is quite the beneficial one. Apart from networking, learning leadership, and other buzzwords, usually they have the privileges to join face to face bootcamps, stay in a comfy hotel, and eat gourmet and how the heck am I supposed to refuse that!?

And thus so I grind for 3 years on doing UI/UX design only to found out the harsh reality of what corporate offices need, and what is actually happening in the industry.

## What is Actually Happening On the Industry
UI/UX design tends to be generally held by the higher ups and quite unecessary with the amount of UI component libraries (e.g MUI, AntDesign, Chakra, etc) used it is quite clear that UI/UX is only a *"Good to have"* set of skills but not necessarily essential, not to mention the tight competition will you have with Multimedia/Arts backgrounded student aswell, you might know the technical know-how, but you might not now aesthetics which is important in that department.

In addition, UI libraries are used because of the crunch-times that most IT companies tend to have to develop a software (not to mention if your company uses *SCRUM* for your workflow), the aim of most IT industries nowadays is fast-delivery, less whining.



## What can be learn from this sob-story?
In conclusion, I think the lessons that can be learned from this article can be summed up by these sets of quotes that I've gotten from several friends and colleagues of mine.

> *"In the end, you're in IT, so start gutting computers rather than focusing on aesthetics."*
>
> — A person from my Infra department that wrangled me to use Alpine on his first day.

A harsh truth to the reality, although I find it to be realistic on the current job openings, especially on entry-level work.

> *"Sounds like the company you're working for made some [RedactedCoolWord] decisions. assemble the UI out of 25-110 json objects simultaneously that's what HTML is for"*
>
> — Some individual I met online that wrangled me with ancient PHP relics

This for me stands out, The industry nowadays needs more clean code and optimized codes due to it being mostly written within poor codebases with barely any documentation. Not to mention if you work in finance sectors where so I've heard that they use ancient relics to power up their system (feel free to point out that if and I'm wrong).

### The question right now might be on "what should I do?"
I myself suggest if you're like me when I was a dweeb on doing front-end designs. Then stick to front-end development by actually developing your items, learn the principles in writing clean front-end code, use different tons of frameoworks and mediums before delving into the most obscure frameworks that you'd find in the darkest corners of Github (usually they have spider-webs on them too) till you understand how frameworks typically works, try making it on different mediums (e.g phone, tablets, desktop apps, etc), make personal projects and post them on Githubs.
